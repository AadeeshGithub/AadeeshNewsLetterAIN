              <p>Kathmandu: Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' on Friday lost a vote of confidence in Parliament after the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) withdrew its support for his government.
                Prachanda, 69, received 63 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives (HoR). There were 194 votes against the motion.
                At least 138 votes are needed to win the vote of trust. Prachanda has survived four trust votes since he assumed the post on December 25, 2022.

                Former prime minister K P Sharma Oli-led CPN-UML withdrew support from the Prachanda-led government last week after inking a power-sharing deal with the largest party in the House - Nepali Congress.
                
                Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba has already endorsed Oli as the next prime minister.

              <p>New Delhi: Retail inflation rate accelerated to 5.08% in June from 4.75% in May, government data showed on Friday.
                A Reuters poll of 54 economists had forecast retail inflation at 4.80%. The inflation, however, remains within the Reserve Bank of India's comfort level of below 6 per cent. The government has tasked the central bank to ensure retail inflation remains at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side. The central bank mainly factors in the CPI to arrive at its bi-monthly monetary policy decision. The next policy review is scheduled early next month.</p>

              <p>Jaipur: A private university in Rajasthan is facing investigation for allegedly issuing fake and backdated degrees for courses that it did not have the accreditation for. The alleged fake degree count stands at 43,409.
                The Rajasthan police's Special Operation Group (SOG) is investigating the alleged fake degrees issued by Om Prakash Jogender Singh (OPJS) University in Churu since its inception in 2013.
                
                The university came under the scanner on April 8 after 1,300 applicants for 2022 physical training instructor (PTI) exam submitted degrees from the university. The course at the university received accreditation only in 2016 and for just 100 seats. Only students enrolled before 2020 were eligible for the PTI 2022 exam.</p>

                The report comes as Apple faces increased antitrust scrutiny in other regions (Representational)
                
                
                New Delhi: An investigation by the country's antitrust body has found that Apple exploited its dominant position in the market for app stores on its iOS operating system, engaging "in abusive conduct and practices", a confidential report seen by Reuters showed.
                The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been investigating Apple since 2021 for possibly abusing its dominant position in the app market by forcing developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system.
                
                Apple has denied wrongdoing saying it was a small player in India where phones that use Google's Android system are dominant.</p>

                A bench of Justice Abhay S Oka and Justice Augustine George Masih said courts cannot curtail the liberty of an accused in a casual manner.
                
                "The courts should stay bail order only in rare and exceptional cases like somebody is involved in terrorist cases, where order is perverse or provisions of law have been bypassed. You cannot restrict liberty like this. This will be disastrous. If we grant stay like this, this will be disaster. Where will Article 21 go," the bench observed.</p>
